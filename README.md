* Includes a complete and detailed description of third party services used in the app

##### 2. List and describe any 3rd party services.
* Precisely explains and shows understanding of the different high-level components of the app

##### 3.1. Identify the problem you’re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App?
* Demonstrates a full understanding of the problems that exist in a relevant marketplace that needs disrupting


##### 3.2 Why is the problem identified a problem that needs solving?
* Demonstrates a full understanding of the problems that exist in a relevant marketplace that needs disrupting

##### 4. Describe your project’s models in terms of the relationships (active record associations) they have with each other.
* Complete discussion of the project’s models with an understanding of how its active record associations function

##### 5. Discuss the database relations to be implemented.
![This is an image of your ERD](This is the relative path to it)
* Provides coherent discussion of the database relations, with reference to the ERD


##### 6. Provide your database schema design.
* Flawless, complex, complete, and well thought through ERDs provided

##### 7. Provide User stories for your App.
![This is an image of your user stories](This is the relative path to it)
* You also just use normal markdown to describe them
* User stories are well thought out, relevant, and comprehensively cover the needs of the app

##### 8. Provide Wireframes for your App.

![This is an image of your wire frames](This is the relative path to it)  
* More than five detailed and well designed wireframes provided, for several different screen sizes (as required for the app)

##### 9. Describe the way tasks are planned and tracked in your project.

##### 10. ERD provided represents a normalised database model.
![This is an image of your ERD](This is the relative path to it)
* Meets D with no duplication and ideal definition of entities.

## Section 3: Code specific assessment. 

This section can be deleted from the readme. I have only included it here to draw your attention to it. 

##### 11. Model implementation represents a normalised database model.
* Meets D with no duplication and ideal model implementation.

##### 12. Model implementation represents a normalised database model.
* Meets D and represents a highly optimised solution.

##### 13. Implemented controllers demonstrate correct use of commands to query the database infrastructure.
* Meets D and does so elegantly (queries chosen are the most elegant to achieve the result).

##### 14. Queries implemented provide correct data for the given scenario.
* Meets CR and demonstrates exceptional understanding of database queries.

##### 15. Code comments demonstrate how the queries implemented correctly represent the database structure.
* Meets D and all comments are exceptionally written.

##### 16. Identify and use appropriate model methods.
